>###  _The rekindling..._

### **Purpose**

I am doing this course in order to free me from Africa.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- _Man's Search for Meaning_ by Viktor Frankl
- _Paradise Lost_ by John Milton
- *The Prince* by Nicoll√≤ Machiavelli

### Dreams

Last night I dreamt about the following:

- [x] Losing my teeth
- [ ] Snakes
- [x] Warmer socks

### Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is to `never get in touch with me`
